# Digikey Cache

This directory needs to be here for the digikey cache to work.

When the program is run for the first time, it will launch a browser window
for you to log into digikey.

Upon successful login, the program will create `token_storage.json` in this
directory. This file contains the access and refresh tokens needed to access
the digikey API.
